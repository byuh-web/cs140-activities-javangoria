        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> "<strong>The North Shore</strong> is known for <em class="emphasized-choice">sandy beaches, clear water and big winter waves</em>. Some days are calm and great for swimming, and other days are best for watching surfers. This page highlights a few famous spots and what each one is known for."</p>

        <h3>Sunset Beach</h3>
        <p><strong>Sunset Beach</strong> has a long shoreline and great views at the end of the day. Winter swells can bring big surf, and calmer seasons are perfect for walks and relaxing by the water.</p>

    <li style="color: #00263e; font-style: italic;">
        The color I chose to emphasize text is Midnight Navy (#00263e).
    </li>
    <li style="color: #100f0f; font-style: normal;">
        The color I chose to de-emphasize text is Dark neutral (#100f0f).
    </li>
    <li style="color: #000000;">
        I chose Midnight Navy because it is a deep, calming color that reflects the ocean theme of the beaches. It stands out well against lighter backgrounds, making emphasized text easy to read.
