            <h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
            
            <p><strong>What is normal flow in HTML?</strong><br>
            Normal flow is how the browser lays out elements by default: block elements (like divs) stack vertically, and inline elements (like spans) sit side-by-side. Elements follow the order they appear in the HTML code.</p>

            <p><strong>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</strong><br>
            Float pushes an element to the left or right, allowing text to wrap around it. You must "clear" a float because floated elements are taken out of the normal document flow, which can cause the parent container to collapse or following elements to overlap.</p>

            <p><strong>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</strong><br>
            <strong>Relative</strong> shifts an element without affecting its neighbors. <strong>Absolute</strong> positions an element relative to its nearest "positioned" ancestor. <strong>Fixed</strong> sticks an element to the viewport, so it stays in place even when you scroll.</p>

            <p><strong>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</strong><br>
            You can check the class portal like Canvas, the Youtube videos, or reliable resources like MDN and W3Schools for specific concepts!</p>
