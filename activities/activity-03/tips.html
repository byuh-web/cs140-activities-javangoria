        <p>Japan is one of the most popular international destinations right now.</p>
        <p>In April 2025, Japan welcomed a record-breaking 3.9 million international visitors, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO). One of the most tourist friendly destinations, there is a learning curve to traveling here, and knowing how to navigate and plan accordingly will ensure a better travel experience.</p>
        <p>From basic etiquette and can’t miss public transportation tips to planning the best time of year to visit (and knowing best time of year to avoid), here are ten essential travel tips every first time traveler needs to know to plan the best visit possible to Japan.</p>

        <h2>1. Know The Visa, Immigration And Tourist Tax Rules In Japan</h2>
        <p>U.S. passport holders do not need a visa to enter Japan. Your passport must be valid at the time of entry and for the duration of your time in Japan. You'll need one blank page in your passport for entry and exit stamps. An international tourist tax in the amount of 1,000 yen ($7 USD) is automatically included in your departure airfare.</p>
        <p>While the Japanese government has begun discussions over whether or not to implement a ‘tourist tax’ on foreign visitors which could come into effect as soon as 2026, accommodation taxes in major cities including Kyoto are already under way.</p>
        <p>Currently, international travelers are exempt from Japan’s 10% consumption tax, however starting Nov. 1, 2026, visitors will have to request a refund for Japan’s tax-free shopping program. Until that takes effect, by presenting your Passport at the time of purchase, tourists will continues to enjoy tax free shopping across the country.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Fill out your immigration and customs declaration information at Visit Japan Web before your trip if you want to save time at the airport when you land. Once completed, you will receive a QR Code which you’ll need to present at immigration in Japan. This simple tip will save you a lot of time when you land, otherwise you will need to fill this out and wait upon arrival.</p>

        <h2>2. Time Your Trip Right For The Best Experience</h2>
        <p>Japan is a year-round destination and there’s never a shortage of places to go or things to do depending on the time of year. The busiest, and most popular time of year to visit is in the springtime for cherry blossom season. The exact timing depends on the weather, however cherry blossoms typically begin to bloom around mid-to-late March through early April and you can expect hotel prices to be at their highest during this time.</p>
        <p>Wintertime brings lower temperatures and fewer tourists and is a great time to visit a local onsen (hot spring) or plan a visit to Hokkaido for skiing or snowboarding. Summertime can be busy and hot across mainland Japan, and while nature-centric activities abound, summer is a great time to consider a visit to Japan’s southernmost prefecture of Okinawa. Fall is ideal weather-wise and is a great time for leaf peeping and touring thanks to a comfortable climate and plenty of cultural activities and festivals.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> There’s never a bad time to visit Japan, however if you want to avoid high prices at hotels and lots of crowds, it’s advisable to steer clear of Golden Week. Typically, Golden Week starts around the end of April until the beginning of May and is when domestic travelers take their holiday so you can expect to see higher prices, less availability at hotels, and larger crowds at popular tourist sites and attractions.</p>

        <h2>3. Book The Right Hotel For Your Stay</h2>
        <p>When it comes to hotels in Japan, from sweeping skyscraper hotels and traditional Japanese ryokans (Japanese inns) to cozy capsules and love hotels, there’s truly something for every traveler on every budget.</p>
        <p>Make sure to book hotel reservations in advance.</p>
        <p>In Tokyo, staying in a neighborhood like Shibuya, Shinjuku, or Ginza is a great way for first-time visitors to get the most out of their visit. A five-minute walk to Shibuya Station, Hotel Indigo Tokyo Shibuya offers modern Western-style rooms and incredible views in arguably one of the best locations in town. For something a bit more budget-friendly, Shiba Park Hotel is a book themed hotel within walking distance to Tokyo Tower and is a great cost effective option. TRUNK Hotel Cat Street is 15-room boutique hotel located between Shibuya, Harajuku, and Omotesando and is a great respite for the sustainability-conscious traveler.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Many hotels in Japan offer in-room loungewear called a yukata at no additional cost for guests to wear during their stay.</p>

        <h2>4. Understand The Tipping Culture In Japan</h2>
        <p>Tipping is not a part of the culture in Japan. However you might find that some restaurants, izakaya’s (Japanese pubs), and bars in Tokyo’s Golden Gai district have a table charge at night that typically ranges anywhere from ¥300 and ¥1,000 (less than $5). This table charge will be added to your tab which is customary and typically disclosed in advance.</p>
        <p>While tipping is generally not expected at restaurants or for taxis, there are some exceptions to the no tipping rule. If you have a fantastic private tour guide or have the chance to experience dinner with a geisha, tipping at your discretion, while not expected, is appreciated.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When appropriate, you should present your tip and follow it with a polite head bow to the person you are tipping as a sign of respect.</p>

        <h2>5. Carry Cash—Not Everywhere In Japan Takes Cards</h2>
        <p>While credit and debit cards are widely accepted across Japan, it’s a good idea to have plenty of Japanese currency (JPY) on hand. While most credit cards are accepted, many places will not accept American Express so you should plan on bringing multiple bank cards just in case.</p>
        <p>U.S currency is not accepted in Japan, however you can exchange USD for Japanese Yen at hotels and banks across the country. ATM’s are located at convenience stores (Konbini’s) across the country and are considered safe to use.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Having a small coin purse on you will help keep smaller change in the form of Japanese yen on hand.</p>

        <h2>6. Reserve Restaurants In Advance</h2>
        <p>Japan is home to more Michelin-starred restaurants than any other country on earth, and while you don’t have to shell out a fortune to eat well, you should plan on making reservations at top-rated restaurants well in advance.</p>
        <p>Vending machine ramen restaurants are a unique part of the food culture in Japan and are a can’t miss experience. Plan on using Japanese Yen for these, along with smaller restaurants, izakaya’s, and food markets.</p>
        <p>If you find yourself in Japan without a reservation, don’t fret. With thousands of restaurants to choose from, Tabelog is the county’s go-to restaurant reservation app. You can also ask your hotel concierge to help with last minute restaurant requests.</p>
        <p>No matter where you go, be prepared to queue up. Waiting on line is a part of the dining culture in Japan, and typically, the better or more popular the restaurant, the longer the wait.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Train stations and malls are a great place to find a wide variety eateries and stock up on local snacks and souvenirs.</p>

        <h2>7. Brush Up On Etiquette And Manners</h2>
        <p>From removing your shoes before entering certain establishments and sacred spaces to bowing as a sign of respect when you’re greeting someone, not speaking loudly on your cell phone in public, and bathing rituals at the local onsen (hot spring) there’s a learning curve when it comes to understanding Japanese etiquette.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of resources and books dedicated to Japanese etiquette, and a basic understanding of politeness and punctuality are integral to Japanese life that should be adhered to throughout your time in Japan.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Loudly slurping your soba noodles or ramen is, surprisingly enough, socially acceptable. Don’t feel like you’re being rude by slurping loudly, it’s a part of the culture and these meals are meant to be sipped, slurped and enjoyed without holding back.</p>

        <h2>8. Use Trains And Buses To Get Around</h2>
        <p>Trains and buses are the best and most cost effective ways to get around in Japan. Public transportation is incredibly safe, clean, and efficient. You’ll want to invest in a prepaid subway card called an IC Card which can be downloaded directly onto your smartphone and refilled automatically along the way.</p>
        <p>Suica and Pasmo are the two most popular IC cards, and they can be purchased, used, and refilled automatically on your phone or at just about every subway station and konbini (convenience stores) around Japan. Your IC Card is good to use for buses, subways, and ferries and can even be used to purchase items at convenience stores and vending machines around the city. It’s important to note that an IC Card is different from a Japan Rail Pass (JR Pass). While IC cards can be used on select shinkansen lines, fares will vary.</p>
        <p>A Japan Rail Pass or JR Pass is a good investment for visitors who plan on traveling extensively throughout Japan. A JR Pass can be purchased in increments of 7, 14, and 21 consecutive days and includes two types of fares: Green Car and Ordinary Car. While your JR Pass will cover unlimited train rides on most JR trains including Shinkansen (excluding Nozomi and Mizuho Shinkanzen), limited express, express, rapid, and local trains, it’s important to note that some trains do require an additional fee. You can buy your JR Pass in advance of your trip and note that if you’re traveling with large suitcases, you will need to purchase and reserve a seat that includes oversizes baggage which is typically at the end of the train car.</p>
        <p>Taxis and Ubers are also widely available in major cities and very reliable, just note that Uber and taxis operate as the same service. While Ubers and taxis are available, it’s a considerably more expensive option compared to public transportation. Go Taxi is Japan’s go-to taxi app and is available in nearly every prefecture across Japan.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Every passenger (even children) need their own IC Card, meaning you can’t share an IC Card. Public transportation can be a bit confusing for first time travelers and non-native Japanese speakers, however there are always people on hand at train stations and bus terminals if you have questions.</p>

        <h2>9. Visit A Konbini—A Japan Travel Essential</h2>
        <p>Japanese konbini’s (convenience stores) are fundamental to everyday life in Japan. Open 24-7, there are a variety of konbini’s to choose from including 7-Eleven, Lawson, FamilyMart and they can be found just about everywhere in cities big and small across the country.</p>
        <p>You can find a little bit of everything at the konbini, from the ever-popular crustless egg sando to onigiri and bento boxes and tickets to popular attractions like Disneyland. You can also refill your IC Card here and use your IC Card like a credit card to make purchases.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Konbini ATM’s are a reliable place to withdraw money and unlike many Japanese banks accept most foreign ATM cards.</p>

        <h2>10. Download These Must-Have Apps For Japan Travel</h2>
        <p>There are a few apps you’re going to need during your time in Japan. Google Maps will be your best friend on the ground in Japan and while knowing a few basic Japanese phrases like konnichiwa (hello) and arigato (thank you) is a good start, Google Translate is both helpful and necessary in effectively communicating when you need a bit a of a boost.</p>
        <p>Your smartphone is also equipped with a camera that can translate from Japanese to English in real time and having a currency converter calculator will come in handy when you’re trying to figure out how to quickly convert Japanese Yen to USD. For restaurant reservations, Tabelog is Japan’s go to app and has tens of thousands of restaurants divided by city. For transportation, download your Suica Card and refill it on your phone as needed.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> WiFi hotspots are widely available across major cities including Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, however if you’re traveling to smaller cities and more remote regions you might want to consider purchasing a pocket wifi or local SIM card which can be found when you land at the airport in Japan or at local convenience stores across the country.</p>
